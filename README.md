# Diary Angular

[Diary app](http://julien-breiner.com) Front End
- Track your Expenses by categories, and set up Reports
- Track Events by categories
- Track People you meet
- Create Lists of various things
- View everything on a Calendar

Altough I'm extensively using this app, its main purpose is to serve as portfolio.
